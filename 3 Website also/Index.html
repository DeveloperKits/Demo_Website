				<p title="biograpy" ><mark><strong>Joker</strong> is a <u>2019</u> American  thriller film directed by Todd Phillips, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver</mark>. The film, based on DC Comics characters, stars Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. An origin story set in <u>1981</u>, the film follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian who turns to a life of crime and chaos in Gotham City. Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Glenn Fleshler, Bill Camp, Shea Whigham, and Marc Maron appear in supporting roles. Joker was produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, DC Films, and Joint Effort in association with Bron Creative and Village Roadshow Pictures, and distributed by Warner Bros.

                Phillips conceived Joker in <u>2016</u> and wrote the script with Silver throughout <u>2017</u>. The two were inspired by 1970s character studies and the films of Martin Scorsese, who was initially attached to the project as a producer. The graphic novel Batman: The Killing <em><mark>Joke (1988)</mark></em> was the basis for the premise, but Phillips and Silver otherwise did not look to specific comics for inspiration. Phoenix became attached in February <u>2018</u> and was cast that July, while the majority of the cast signed on by August. Principal photography took place in New York City, Jersey City, and Newark, from September to December <u>2018</u>. It is the first live-action theatrical Batman film to receive an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, due to its violent and disturbing content</p>
